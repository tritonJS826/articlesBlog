Whe have a group of people (2 for example).  We have also some issue to solve. Shoud we choose leader or shoud we play in parlament and vote?
Answer could be calculated by checking two factors: personal skills and level of luckyness. For example: if someone in 100% right (no luckyness, ony skills) he should be the leader in this issue and it make sense to ask him to solve it. But if they have only 50% percents chance to be right they should obviously vote (no skills, only lyckyness).

(Next sentense is assumption)
If one have 75% chance to be right, they should vote with weight 75:25 obviously.

Ok, now we can calculate weight of vote based on skills. Let's think about hierarchial systems, trees, how deep should they be?
It's easy - when we have a leader in small group (2) we have a hierarchy (tree) - leader - is a parent node.
What if divide all people by pairs and calculate first iteration? Some group will be flat (no leaders), some become hierarchial.
And all groups will have some skill level in comparison with other. We can make another iteration on the top level and we wil get three layers. If we will continue we will get in the end highest level. 

Interesting will it be big group? Which parameters are mostly responsible for the top group size?
