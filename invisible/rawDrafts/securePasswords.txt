For AES-256
Average computer can brute ~ 10 ** 15 passwords a year
Super computer can brute ~ 10 ** 22 passwords a year

That mean passwords with length less than 12 unsecure in case with government.

For quantum computer: to crack AES-256 required 6600 logical, error-corrected qubits. It's become soon (now 433-qubit machine available)a

RSA is more slow, nut the key size of RSA is 1024, 2048, 3072, 7600 bytes, so it's much more robustnes with long passwords
